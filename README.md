# Embedded Projects  

Welcome to my **Embedded Projects** repository! 🚀  

## 📖 Embedded Systems Overview  
Embedded systems are specialized computing systems designed to perform dedicated functions within larger systems. These systems typically involve microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and efficient software written in C or C++. This repository contains hands-on embedded projects, demonstrating various concepts like digital and analog inputs, PWM control, and communication protocols.
