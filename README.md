## 🔧 Current Projects  
### 1️⃣ Blinking LED  
🔹 A simple circuit where an LED lights up with a set interval.  

---

### 2️⃣ Button-Activated LED  
🔹 A simple circuit where an LED lights up when a button is pressed.  
🔹 Demonstrates **digital input** handling and basic microcontroller interfacing.  

---

### 3️⃣ Potentiometer-Controlled LED  
🔹 Adjust LED brightness using an **analog potentiometer**.  
🔹 Introduces **analog input** and **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**.  

---

### 4️⃣ Serial Communication Test  
🔹 Sends data over the serial monitor using `Serial.print()` and reads analog or digital values.  
🔹 Useful for debugging and sensor feedback.  
🔹 Introduces **UART communication** and basic serial protocols.

---

### 5️⃣ Timer & Interrupt Demo  
🔹 Uses `millis()` to toggle an LED at regular intervals without blocking other code.  
🔹 Implements **interrupts** via `attachInterrupt()` to respond to button presses.  
🔹 Demonstrates concepts like **non-blocking timing** and **interrupt service routine (ISR)**.

### 💡 **Interactive LED Control Panel** (Milestone Project)  
> 🔁 Multi-mode LED control panel using analog input, button interrupts, PWM, and serial output.

🔸 Features:
- Interrupt-driven button switches between modes  
- Potentiometer adjusts behavior based on current mode  
- Red channel of RGB LED used for output  

🔸 Modes:
- **Mode 0** – Blink speed control  
- **Mode 1** – Brightness control  
- **Mode 2** – Red color intensity
